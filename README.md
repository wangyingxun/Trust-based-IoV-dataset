# Value of the Data in an Internet of Vehicles Network
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) manifests a highly dynamic communication network that facilitates interactions between vehicles via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicles and supporting roadside infrastructure via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians via Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication, and vehicles and backbone network via Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) communication, thereby realizing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. With the rapid advancement of information and communication technology and artificial intelligence, IoV network is also experiencing a period of rapid growth. However, when it comes to the security of an IoV network, there still remains considerable challenges. In particular, conventional cryptography-based schemes are inadequate for addressing internal security attacks in the context of a highly dynamic and distributed IoV network. On the contrary, trust-based approaches have demonstrated a potential for intelligently addressing such attacks. Trust, in essence, refers to the probability of a trustee to realize a certain action or a set of services, i.e., requested by a trustor, in an appropriate manner at a particular instance of time. Trust values, expressed within the range of [0, 1], serve as a quantitative measure for evaluating the trustworthiness of a trustee with 0 implying untrustworthiness and 1 suggesting trustworthiness
